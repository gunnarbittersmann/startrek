Janeway activates a beacon to direct the team to the ship while defending it from the planet’s attempt to attack it. When they spend most of the day traveling in circles due to terraforming (moving the land area) to keep the team 10 kilometers away, Dal & Gwyn ultimately find the solution that gets them heading in the right direction, unfortunately finding that Dreadnok and The Diviner are on the planet as well. A daring escape and a shocking betrayal leads to the team finding the ship at last and getting off Murder Planet. A final confrontation between the Protostar and the Diviner’s ship ultimately reveals the biggest secret of the experimental ship’s name.",

					"abstract": "The Protostar comes out of warp and the Proto Drive is inactive after a 4,000-light-year jump from the Delta Quadrant into the Gamma Quadrant. While the others work to reactivate the Proto Drive, Dal seeks to prove his abilities as a captain by taking on the most difficult training exercise in Starfleet: The Kobayashi Maru. Using the simulated bridge of the Enterprise-D, he selects a crew of the best that Starfleet has to advise him: Spock, Scotty & Uhura (from the Original Series), Odo (from DS9), and Dr. Crusher (from TNG). After multiple attempts to pass, he finally beats the simulation using a very unorthodox method, only to inadvertently launch a photon torpedo at the Enterprise-D and destroy it. Dal then realizes that the Maru is a no-win scenario and that a good captain accepts some situations as unsolvable. Gwyn uses her knowledge of languages to decipher a section of code in Janeway’s memory bank that reveals the Protostar may not have gone into the Delta Quadrant by chance."

They find a distant Starfleet space station and make contact with its caretaker, Lt. Frex, to request asylum & join Starfleet. A biometric scan reveals facts about the crew, particularly that Jankom’s Tellurite race is a founding Federation member and that Gwyn’s race is unknown to Starfleet. A stunning revelation is that Dal’s race is known to the Federation and that information needs to be reported to Starfleet as soon as possible. As the rest of the crew explores the station, Zero and Gwyn use the station’s Sickbay to recover memories lost when Gwyn caught a brief glimpse of Zero on Tars Lamora. When Frex attempts to access Protostar’s ship logs, he unknowingly activates the “weapon” The Diviner placed aboard it which proceeds to corrupt the station’s computer and destroy itself from within. Frex accuses the crew of being saboteurs and departs in the station’s only escape pod. With Rahk-Takk’s mind going into action, the team finds a way to escape the station’s destruction and return to the ship when Gwyn reveals that her memory has been restored and that she now knows everything. Meanwhile, Admiral Janeway aboard the USS Dauntless continues to investigate the reasoning behind the Protostar being in the Gamma Quadrant and why its original Captain Chakotay—her former second-in-command aboard the USS Voyager—failed to call for help if he was in danger, in addition to where the ship may currently be headed. She arrives on Tars Lamora where she finds The Diviner lying in stasis and plans to possibly get more information from him.",

They conduct a search of the ship but find nothing until a hidden set of letters from Gwyn’s home of Solum is located on the Bridge. Her “heirloom” becomes a key revealing a hidden sub-deck where they find the device. Attempts to destroy it fail as it possesses a self-defense sentience. An alert signals a ship in front of the Protostar, and it is revealed to be a deactivated Borg Cube. The discovery intrigues everyone else but Hologram Janeway has severe trepidations due to past experiences with the race. Dal and company think that maybe the Borg can help figure out how to remove the device so Janeway reluctantly agrees to try and board the Cube. Once aboard, Zero uses their ability to link to the ship’s system but the crew are suddenly overwhelmed as their actions awaken the dormant Borgs and capture the crew for assimilation. Zero is assimilated into the collective but Gwyn helps break them away when she alerts them that they swore not to harm anyone but allowing assimilations would counter their belief. Zero returns to normal, puts the entire ship back into dormancy and the team return to Protostar. The crew learn that the device is a living construct and cannot be removed or destroyed but decide to continue to use the ship to conduct heroic missions as they respond to a distress signal. Aboard the Dauntless, Admiral Janeway learns that The Diviner is somewhat conscious but not completely to where she can question him regarding the ship. Lt. Ascensia suggests using the bio-serum in the suit he was in to rejuvenate him to which Janeway agrees. Directing the ship to the last Protostar warp signature, they arrive to find the remains of CR 721 which was destroyed in the previous episode. Janeway comes to the conclusion that Chakotay is no longer in control of the Protostar and that whoever does must be a threat to be stopped. Janeway has The Diviner revived and he awakens.",
