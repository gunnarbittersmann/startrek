						"en": "On the Tars Lamora prison colony in the Delta Quadrant, a young alien named Dal dreams of escaping. The colony’s leader, The Diviner, sends his robotic enforcer Drednok to capture a problematic prisoner, “Zero”, who causes an explosion that allows Dal to get away. Dal is captured before he can escape and is interrogated by the Diviner’s daughter Gwyn, who gives him one day to locate Zero. Descending to the deep core mining level, Dal is partnered with a Brikar who speaks another language and grows angry at Dal’s attempts to search for Zero, accidentally causing a rock collapse that reveals the abandoned Federation starship USS Protostar. The starship’s translator allows the Brikar to introduce herself as Rok-Tahk. Zero watches this happen and introduces themselves, while the group is expanded to include engineer Jankom Pog and indestructible blob Murf. When they are confronted by Drednok and Gwyn, they take Gwyn hostage and escape from Tars Lamora in the Protostar. They are greeted by a training hologram with the likeness of former USS Voyager Captain Kathryn Janeway."

While Zero, Jankom, Rok-Tahk and Murf are eager to join the Federation, Dal—who has appointed himself Captain of the ship—dismisses Janeway. When he unknowingly directs Zero to fly the Protostar into a dying star, Dal is forced to ask for Janeway’s help to save themselves and the ship.

They are then trapped inside their own personal holodeck simulations: Zero’s detective story, Jankom’s street fighting simulation, a jazz club program for Murf, and an amalgam of Dal’s pirate simulation and Rok’s virtual pet game. Zero deduces that by not completing the simulations they can escape, and the crew are able to end the program. Hologram Janeway is revealed to have trapped them in the holodeck, acting under a secret subroutine programmed by the construct to keep them distracted until they reach Federation space.",

Erst wenn eine bestimmte Aufgabe gelöst wurde, kann das Holodeck verlassen werden, was auch gelingt. Es stellt sich heraus, dass das Janeway-Hologramm das Holodeck absichtlich so programmiert hatte, um die Besatzung dort festzuhalten und das Schiff doch noch zur Sternenflotte führen zu können."

At first excited, the recruits are disillusioned because as cadets, they are not allowed to work alongside Janeway, and are snubbed by Nova Squadron, an elite Starfleet fighter pilot squad, led by a young Vulcan named Maj’el. After some unauthorized spying, the cadets discover that Janeway is mounting a secret rescue mission to find Chakotay with a cloak-enabled ship called the Infinity. Janeway swears the cadets to secrecy, but Maj’el overhears Dal discussing this and tries to stop the cadets from moving the Infinity. During the melee, the craft is accidentally activated and sent into the wormhole prematurely. Meanwhile, Gwynn’s attempts to win the trust of the present-day Solum fail as she discovers that Ascencia has manipulated the leaders into believing that Gwyn is a threat, prompting them to order her capture. Gwyn escapes and reunites with Ilthuran, the Diviner’s younger uncorrupted self."

						"en": "The Protostar crew take the Infinity through a Borg conduit, which transports them to an uncharted planet inhabited by a Kazon. The Kazon has Dal, Rok, Gwyn and Jankom captured while Zero and Murf stay behind. Dal/Jankom and Gwyn/Rok are pitted against each other in a rigged and dangerous rat race around the planet’s core. Dal saves Gwyn and Rok but discovers that one of the Kazon’s racers is a robot. Meanhile, the Kazon’s erratic behavior leads Zero and Murf to uncover a mind control device on him, which they disable. The Kazon then reveals that the planet was a pilot training facility, until the computer became sentient and went rogue, arranging pilot deaths one at a time until only he remained. The computer reveals itself to Zero and further explains its warped agenda, before arresting Murf with a mind control device and capturing the others. Zero declares that they are all biological beings and reasserts faith in the others before crashing into the computer’s core, causing an explosion that destroys the entity. Zero’s containment suit is severely damaged, making independent movement impossible, so Zero is carried and they all continue on their way. On board Voyager, a suspicious Maj’el follows holographic Gwyn to her quarters, where a strange entity tries to destroy the hologram, mistaking it for the real Gwyn. The creature vanishes after realizing its mistake and Maj’el enters the quarters to find Gwyn gone."

						"en": "Zero makes contact with another Medusan who offers to give Zero a new body. Gwyn convinces Dal to help Zero and the group detours to Ovidia IV, where the message came from. There, they discover that the resident Medusans and other non-corporeal beings have been using carbon-based matter from the planet’s surroundings to create physical bodies for themselves, providing them the senses of touch, smell, and taste. Since this also will allow Zero to interact directly with other corporeal beings without harming them, Zero agrees to the transfiguration. The operation is a success and Zero takes delight in experiencing newly given senses and participates in the Feast of Senses – a celebration and rite of passage on Ovidia IV. At first happy for their friend, Dal and Gwyn learn from the Medusan leader Ion that because their bodies degenerate outside Ovidia IV, no one wants to leave and give up their senses. Dal and Gwyn discover that Zero is participating in the “Running of the Nazamon”, in which participants experience the sense of fear while feeding and fleeing from the Nazamon, a manta ray-like creature. Dal, Gwyn and the others manage to find Zero and tell him the truth. When Dal is snatched up in the Nazamon’s gaping maw, Zero bravely jumps to Dal’s rescue. Trusting the Nazamon to use its senses and their friends down below, they ride the Nazamon to safety. By the time they reach the finish line, Zero thanks Zion for the experience and ultimately decides to risk leaving Ovidia IV with the Infinity crew as they had risked their lives to reveal the truth. Ion respects Zero’s choice and wishes them luck. Meanwhile, Janeway, The Doctor and Commander Tysses discover the holographic imposters and hunt down Gwyn’s hologram, who tells them about the possible message from Chakotay. The Doctor discovers that the ship’s computer log has been altered and holographic Gwyn tells of the clicking noises from the creature that tried to erase her. Fearing the worst, Janeway sets a new course to find the real Gwyn before the creatures do."

Wesley explains that he has found a way for the kids to repair their unravelling timeline. He also explains that the “hole in time” the kids created are attracting The Loom – monstrous, parasitic creatures who feed on dying timelines and manipulate time to hunt their prey. Just then, the Loom arrive, causing Dal, Rohk, Zero, Jankom and Murf to freeze in time. Gwyn and Wesley (who both have temporal stabilizers) are not affected. The duo hurry to find more stabilizers for their friends, with the Loom in hot pursuit. After placing the stabilizer armbands, Gwyn, Dal, Zero, Jankom, Rohk, Murf and Wesley jump through the vault to escape the Loom. The vault sends them to a safety bunker in the style of a Earth apartment in the 1960s–1970s. Meanwhile, Admiral Janeway tracks down the Infinity’s warp trail, ignoring Admiral Jellico’s orders to return home. The Voyager-A arrives at the Time ziggurat, unaware of the danger that awaits below."

						"en": "While waiting out the Loom, Wesley reveals his plan to work out coordinates for the kids to find Chakotay and repair the timeline. The group also learns from Wesley that the Loom will not only kill them, but erase the fact any of them ever existed. At the same time, Janeway’s Andorian first officer, Commander Tysess prepares to beam down with his landing party. Maj’el joins Commander Tysess, insisting her telepathic link to Zero will help the team locate the Protostar crew. Janeway agrees, only after Tysess declares to protect Maj’el at all costs. Armed with temporal arm bands provided by the Doctor, Tysess, Maj’el and Ensign Middleton beam down the planet. There, they are ambushed by the Loom who kills Middleton. Tysses orders an emergency beam out back to Voyager, but Maj’el determined to find Zero, removes her badge to stay behind. Back on Voyager, Tysess discovers Maj’el missing and reveals to Janeway what happened. Tysess is also surprised when Janeway and the Doctor don’t recall Middleton and (correctly) deduces the Loom’s ability to erase their prey from existence. Back in the Time ziggurat, Maj’el manages to telepathically locate Zero. Maj’el in cornered by the Loom, but is rescued at the last minute by Dal. Maj’el literally falls into Zero’s arms and is amazed by the Medusan’s new appearance. The reunion is cut short when the Loom manage to break into the safety bunker, forcing the group to evacuate back to the surface. The Loom destroys the Inifinity and is surrounds the group. In the nick of time, Janeway saves Wesley and the Protostar crew by firing at the creatures. The Loom respond by attacking Voyager and a battle ensues. Janeway turns the tables for everyone by boarding a shuttlecraft and setting the shuttle’s weapons to the Loom’s phase variance and manages to kill one of the Loom, creating a diversion to the other Loom. Wesely prepares to set the Protostar crew into a time portal to find Chakotay. Disreguarding Wesley’s warnings, Dal risks looking at his future and is disappointed to see a vision of him refusing the role of captain in front of Gwyn. The group begins to panic, but Maj’el manages to calm them down. Maj’el’s wisdom prompts Wesley to discover that Maj’el also part of the solution to correct the future. Janeway arrives and finds the kids, who are relieved to see her. Janeway is shocked to see Wesley and initially protests against Wesley sending young members of her crew across the galaxy, but relents after Dal and Gwyn tell her it’s the only way to save Chakotay and the timeline. The Protostar crew and Maj’el are sent through the portal. With his time manipulation powers, Wesley sends Janeway back to safety onboard Voyager and manages to wipe out the remaining Loom as they storm into the Time Room. The episode ends with Dal, Gwyn, Rohk, Zero, Jankom, Murf and Maj’el finding themselves on a sandy planet and spot a rusty Protostar and it’s equally weathered captain, Chakotay."

						"en": "With the Vau N’Akat in open rebellion against her, Asencia begins to launch a fleet of ships equipped with temporal weaponry at every major Federation base. Voyager and the Protostar attack the fleet to buy time as Wesley, Rok, Zero and Maj’el figure out the calculations to open the wormhole to Tars Lamora, and Dal, Gwyn, Jankom, Murf and Ilthuran beam to Solum to hijack Asencia’s technology. Gwyn battles Asencia, ultimately defeating her after the other Vau N’Akat lend Gwyn their strength. Murf destroys Asencia’s Drednok, allowing Dal and Jankom to open the wormhole which collapses the open rifts onto Asencia’s ships, destroying them and saving the Federation. However, the Loom swarm out of the wormhole to consume reality."

						"en": "With time running out, the crew launches the Protostar into the wormhole, guarded by Voyager. The launch proves successful and before beaming out, Chakotay has The Doctor copy Hologram Janeway onto an EMH backup module. The Protostar lands on Tars Lamora in the past where its eventually found by Dal and Rok, resolving the paradox and causing the Loom to return to their own dimension. With the danger over and the future where Solum is destroyed in a civil war changed, Janeway leads official first contact between the Federation and the Vau N’Akat before deciding to go into early retirement, leaving Chakotay as the new captain of Voyager. Wesley privately tells Dal that the important role the crew is to play in the galaxy’s future is yet to come and visits his mother, meeting his little brother Jack for the very first time. The kids finally get into Starfleet Academy, only to have the attack on Mars drastically change things. Returning to Starfleet in the wake of the attack, Janeway has the new Protostar-class vessel, the USS Prodigy, turned into a training ship and gives it to the former Protostar crew along with field commissions to the rank of ensign. Accepting that Gwyn is the rightful captain and recalling some advice that Chakotay had given him, Dal chooses to serve as her first officer instead while Hologram Janeway is upgraded to become the Prodigy’s Emergency Command Hologram."
